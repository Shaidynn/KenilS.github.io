        <h4>
            Hello! I'm Kenil, a grade 12 student attending high school here at Dr. E.P. Scarlett. I am passionate about
            technology, whether that includes phones, TVs, tablets, computers, or a simple line of code. I have been
            programming in various different languages for about four years nowâ€”in languages such as Java, HTML & CSS,
            Python, and Javascript. I have many projects that I have done over the years, which can be found
